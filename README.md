# Final Project Repository for Team 5 of the 2023 Winter Class MAE ECE 148 at UCSD

Our Final Project has one main objective, which is inspired by a pet dog that plays fetch. Our goal is to design a robot that can identify a green ball, like a tennis ball, locate it, move towards it, pick it up, and return back to its initial location. We achieved this using an OpenCV-based vision system to recognize the ball and Pyvesc to control the car's movements. We also designed a claw mechanism to pick up the ball when it's within range and a servo to move the ball into the claw.

In summary, our project demonstrates the capabilities of an autonomous robot that can navigate an environment, recognize objects, and perform tasks like fetching. With further improvements, this type of robot could have many potential applications in various industries.
